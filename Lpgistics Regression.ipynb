    "3. Why do we use the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression?\n",

    "\n",
    "2) Non-linearity: Logistic Regression deals with classification problems where the relationship between the input features and the outcome is often \n",
    "   non-linear. The Sigmoid function introduces this non-linearity, allowing the model to capture complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Differentiability: The Sigmoid function is differentiable, which is essential for training the model using gradient-based optimization algorithms. \n",
    "   These algorithms require the function to have a derivative to calculate the direction of weight updates during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Interpretability: The output of the Sigmoid function can be easily interpreted as the probability of the event occurring. This makes it \n",
    "   straightforward to understand the model's predictions and assess its confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Mathematical Convenience: The Sigmoid function has several desirable mathematical properties that make it suitable for Logistic Regression, such as\n",

    "4. What is the cost function of Logistic Regression?\n",
    "Log Loss (Cross-Entropy Loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function used in Logistic Regression is called Log Loss, also known as Cross-Entropy Loss. It measures the difference between the predicted\n",
    "probabilities and the actual outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Representation\n",

    "   parameters (weights) that produce predictions as close as possible to the actual outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Penalizing Incorrect Predictions: The Log Loss function heavily penalizes incorrect predictions. If the model predicts a high probability for an \n",
    "   outcome that actually didn't occur (or vice versa), the cost will be high. This encourages the model to learn accurate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "How Regularization Works\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, regularization is achieved by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The loss function is a measure of how well the model\n",

    "There are two main types of regularization used in logistic regression:\n",

    "2. L2 regularization (Ridge): Adds a penalty proportional to the square of the weights. This shrinks the weights towards zero, but typically does not\n",

    "\n",
    "Regularization is needed in logistic regression for the following reasons:\n",

    "1. Prevent Overfitting: As mentioned earlier, it helps prevent the model from learning the training data too well and thereby improving its ability \n",

    "2. Improve Model Generalization: By preventing overfitting, regularization helps the model perform better on unseen data.\n",
    "3. Handle Multicollinearity: When features are highly correlated, it can be difficult for the model to learn the true relationship between the features \n",

    ". Reasoning: While simple, it can be misleading for imbalanced datasets where one class is much more frequent than others.\n",

    ". Focuses on the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive.\n",

    ". Reasoning: Useful when you need to consider both precision and recall, especially with imbalanced datasets.\n",

    "Class imbalance can significantly impact the performance of logistic regression models. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bias Toward the Majority Class: In an imbalanced dataset, where one class significantly outnumbers the other, the model tends to be biased toward \n",

    "class dominates, the model focuses on minimizing errors related to the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Poor Prediction of Minority Class: Since the model is biased toward predicting the majority class, it can lead to poor performance in predicting the \n",
    "minority class. The model might end up predicting the minority class very infrequently, even if the minority class is highly relevant for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Skewed Performance Metrics: Accuracy becomes a misleading metric when class imbalance is present. Even if the model predicts the majority class most\n",

    "recall, F1-score, and the ROC-AUC score are more informative in such situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Probability Calibration: Logistic regression outputs probabilities for class predictions. In cases of severe class imbalance, the model might \n",
